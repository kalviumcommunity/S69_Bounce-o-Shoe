### **Project Overview:**
**Bounce-o-Shoe** is a lighthearted and interactive web app where users can design their own bouncing shoes. The app allows users to customize the shoes' appearance, bounce behavior, and then watch them interact with each other in a physics-driven environment. With adjustable bounce height, speed, and color, users can create a playful, dynamic experience where shoes bounce, collide, and "hop" around the screen. The goal is to have fun with silly, bouncy shoes while learning about physics and animations in a web environment.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Customizable Shoes**:  
   - Users can select different shoe designs (or simple shapes) and change their color. This gives users the freedom to personalize their bouncing shoes.

2. **Adjustable Bounce Settings**:  
   - Sliders or input controls allow users to change how high and how fast their shoe bounces. They can control the shoe's bounce height, speed, and gravity.

3. **Multiple Shoes**:  
   - Users can add more than one shoe to the screen, and these shoes will bounce and collide with each other, creating a chaotic, fun experience.

4. **Realistic Bounce Physics**:  
   - Shoes bounce off walls, floors, and each other using realistic physics (based on Matter.js), providing a dynamic, interactive environment.

5. **Sound Effects**:  
   - When a shoe bounces, it triggers a sound like a "boing" or "splat" to enhance the playful experience.

6. **Save and Share**:  
   - Users can capture a screenshot of their bouncing shoes and share their creations with friends on social media or messaging platforms.

7. **Interactive Controls**:  
   - Simple UI elements like sliders and buttons allow users to tweak the behavior and look of their shoes in real-time.

8. **Full-Screen Experience**:  
   - The bouncing shoes can take over the entire browser window, providing an immersive and entertaining visual display.
